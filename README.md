# Playz: Video-based Decentralized Social Network

![](client/public/landing.png)
## Problem statement
The advent of Web2 revolutionized user interaction, fostering the rapid growth of social media platforms and content creation. Platforms like YouTube offered monetization solutions, effectively turning creators into business entities. However, these platforms leverage user preferences and behaviors as commodities, selling this data back to advertisers. Creators are now realizing that they're renting their audiences from these platforms, making it challenging to transition to more ethical or lucrative digital spaces. In addition to unreliable revenue and issues surrounding content ownership, creators also risk losing their audience's trust with each paid post, reducing their authenticity and engagement. The current Web2 creator economy, reliant on opaque, advertising-based business models, is causing creators to question the disproportionate influence these platforms have over their work and compensation, indicating a rising legitimacy crisis.

## What it does

Playz is an innovative, decentralized social media platform that integrates the best of Web2 and Web3 technologies. It provides a unique space for artists and creators to publish to, and engage with, their fans via exclusive token-gated access and experiences. Built with a TikTok-style user interface, Playz offers an ecosystem of features including community chat, live streaming, and a social marketplace. It functions as an NFT super-app, enabling the creation, minting, and community building aspects of NFTs all under one roof. All the while, bringing content ownership back into the hands of the creator, not the advertising middlemen nor the value-extracting platforms.

## Inspiration

Our inspiration for Playz stemmed from recognizing the potential of Web3 and decentralized systems, and the desire to empower creators by combining this with the familiarity and usability of Web2 platforms. We were also deeply inspired by the idea of community ownership and the notion that communities could come together to create, own, and bring their ideas to life.

## How we built it

- Frontend: NextJS
- Backend: ExpressJS
- Ethereum Library: wagmi, Ethers.js, Hardhat
- Contracts: Solidity v8.17.0
- File Storage: IPFS, web3.storage
- User Interface: Chakra UI

## What's next for Playz

Looking ahead, we have several plans in the pipeline:
- Mobile-first application using React Native
- Subscription-based Memberships (i.e. On-chain Patreon)
- Live-streaming feature using Livepeer
- Tiered memberships to unlock different benefits
- Engagement-based creator revenue model
- In-app secondary market for trading editions
- Launch beta version and iterate with user feedback
