# Playz: Video-based Decentralized Social Network

## Problem statement
The evolution of Web2 significantly changed user interaction dynamics, leading to the rise of social media platforms and content creation. Platforms like YouTube introduced monetization, transforming creators into business entities. However, these platforms commodify user data, selling it to advertisers. Creators face challenges in maintaining their audience's loyalty and authenticity due to the platforms' control over audience engagement and revenue models. This has highlighted a growing crisis in the Web2 creator economy, where issues of content ownership and ethical monetization practices are increasingly questioned.

## Intellectual Property as a Real-World Asset
Intellectual property (IP) is a critical real-world asset, especially for creators in the digital age. Recognizing IP as an asset allows for its valuation, protection, and monetization in ways that traditional Web2 platforms have failed to address adequately. By considering IP as an asset, creators can leverage their work for more sustainable and equitable economic benefits.

## What Playz does

Playz is a trailblazing decentralized social media platform that marries the best of Web2 and Web3. It revolutionizes content ownership by allowing creators to tokenize their IP, offering a robust platform where artists and creators can directly engage with their fans through token-gated access. This model ensures that creators have full control and ownership of their IP, turning their creative output into a tangible, tradeable asset. Features include community chat, live streaming, and a social marketplace, all underpinned by NFT technology that foregrounds IP rights and value.

## Inspiration

The genesis of Playz lies in harnessing the untapped potential of Web3 and decentralized systems. We're driven by the ambition to empower creators by recognizing and tokenizing their IP. This approach aligns with our belief in community ownership, where creators and their communities collaboratively foster and monetize creative works.
